# How to Test Locally
We are using bun as our package manager because it is cool.

1. Clone the repo
2. Setup all your env variables "token, clientId, GuildId".
3. WHEN YOU TEST YOUR BOT ADD IT TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL SERVER. I DO NOT WANT A BUNCH OF TEST BOTS IN NEETCODERS.
4. Use this guide: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot
